  "readme": "# seek-bzip\n\n`seek-bzip` is a pure-javascript Node.JS module adapted from 'node-bzip' and before that antimatter15's pure-javascript implementation for decoding bzip2 data.  `seek-bzip` currently only decodes buffers into other buffers, synchronously.  Unlike `node-bzip`, `seek-bzip` can seek to and decode single blocks from the bzip2 file.\n\n## How to Install\n\n```\nnpm install seek-bzip\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter compressing some example data into `example.bz2`, the following with recreate that original data and save it to `example`.\n\n```\nvar Bunzip = require('seek-bzip');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\nvar compressedData = fs.readFileSync('example.bz2');\nvar data = Bunzip.decode(compressedData);\n\nfs.writeFileSync('example', data);\n```\n\nSee the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.\n\nFor uncompressing single blocks of bzip2-compressed data, you will need\nan out-of-band index listing the start of each bzip2 block.  (Presumably\nyou generate this at the same time as you index the start of the information\nyou wish to seek to inside the compressed file.)  The `seek-bzip` module\nhas been designed to be compatible with the C implementation `seek-bzip2`\navailable from https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2.  That codebase\ncontains a `bzip-table` tool which will generate bzip2 block start indices.\n\n## Documentation\n\n`require('seek-bzip')` returns a `Bunzip` object.  It contains two static\nmethods.  The first is a function accepting one or two parameters:\n\n`Bunzip.decode = function(Buffer inputBuffer, [Number expectedSize])`\n\nIf `expectedSize` is not present, `decodeBzip` simply decodes `inputBuffer` and returns the resulting `Buffer`.\n\nIf `expectedSize` is present, `decodeBzip` will store the results in a `Buffer` of length `expectedSize`, and throw an error in the case that the size of the decoded data does not match `expectedSize`.\n\nThe second is a function accepting two or three parameters:\n\n`Bunzip.decodeBlock = function(Buffer inputBuffer, Number blockStartBits, [Number expectedSize])`\n\nThe `inputBuffer` and `expectedSize` parameters are as above.\nThe `blockStartBits` parameter gives the start of the desired block, in bits.\n\n## Help wanted\n\nThe following improvements to this module would be generally useful.\nFeel free to fork on github and submit pull requests!\n\n* Streaming interface.  The original `micro-bunzip2` and `seek-bzip2` codebases\ncontained a slightly more complicated input/output system which allowed\nstreaming chunks of input and output data.  It wouldn't be hard to retrofit\nthat to this code base.\n\n* Port the `bzip-table` tool from the `seek-bzip2` codebase, so that index\ngeneration is self-contained.  Again, not very hard!\n\n* Add command-line binaries to the node module for `bzip-table` and\n`seek-bunzip`.\n\n* Add compression along with decompression.
