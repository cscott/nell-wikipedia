# lzmajs

`lzmajs` is a fast pure-JavaScript implementation of LZMA
compression/decompression.  It was originally written by Gary Linscott
based on decompression code by Juan Mellado and the 7-Zip SDK.
C. Scott Ananian cleaned up the source code and packaged it for `node`
and `volo`.

## How to install

```
npm install lzma-purejs
```
or
```
volo add cscott/lzma-purejs
```

This package uses
[Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Typed_arrays)
and so requires node.js >= 0.5.5.  Full browser compatibility table
is available at [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/typedarrays); briefly:
IE 10, Firefox 4, Chrome 7, or Safari 5.1.

## Testing

```
npm install
npm test
```

## Usage

There is a binary available in bin:
```
$ bin/lzmajs --help
$ echo "Test me" | bin/lzmajs -z > test.lzma
$ bin/lzmajs -d test.lzma
Test me
```

From JavaScript:
```
var lzmajs = require('lzma-purejs');
var data = new Buffer('Example data', 'utf8');
var compressed = lzma.compressFile(data);
var uncompressed = lzma.uncompressFile(compressed);
// convert from array back to string
var data2 = new Buffer(uncompressed).toString('utf8');
console.log(data2);
```
There is a streaming interface as well.

See the tests in the `tests/` directory for further usage examples.

## Documentation

`require('lzma-purejs')` returns a `lzmajs` object.  It contains two main
methods.  The first is a function accepting one, two, three or four
parameters:

`lzmajs.compressFile = function(input, [output], [Number compressionLevel] or [props], [progress])`

The `input` argument can be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`readByte` method), or a `Uint8Array`, `Buffer`, or array.

If you omit the second argument, `compressFile` will return a JavaScript
array containing the byte values of the compressed data.  If you pass
a second argument, it must be a "stream" object (which must implement the
`writeByte` method).

The third argument may be omitted, or a number between 1 and 9 indicating
a compression level (1 being largest/fastest compression and 9 being
smallest/slowest compression), or else an object with fields specifying
specific lzma encoder parameters; see `lib/Util.js` for details.

The fourth argument, if present, is a callback which will be invoked
multiple times as `progress(inSize, outSize)`, where inSize is the number of
input stream bytes which have currently been processed, and outSize is the
corresponding number of output bytes which have been generated.

The second exported method is a function accepting one or two parameters:

`lzmajs.decompressFile = function(input, [output])`

The `input` parameter is as above.

If you omit the second argument, `decompressFile` will return a
`Uint8Array`, `Buffer` or JavaScript array with the decompressed
data, depending on what your platform supports.  For most modern
platforms (modern browsers, recent node.js releases) the returned
value will be a `Uint8Array`.

If you provide the second argument, it must be a "stream", implementing
the `writeByte` method.
