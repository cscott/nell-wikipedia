A '''star''' is a massive ball of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (very hot gas) held together by [[gravity]]. It [[Radiation|radiates]] because of the [[nuclear reaction]]s inside it.

It radiates [[heat]] and [[light]], and every other part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[radio]] waves, [[microwave]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s and [[UV]]. The proportions vary according to the [[mass]] and age of the star.

The [[energy]] of stars comes from [[nuclear fusion]] -- a process of turning one [[chemical element]] into another. Most stars are mostly made of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. They turn the [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]]. When a star is near the end of its life, it begins to change the [[helium]] into other [[chemical element]]s, like [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. Fusion produces a lot of energy. The energy makes the star very hot. The energy produced by stars [[radiation|radiates]] away from them. It is [[electromagnetic radiation]].

== Birth of a star ==
A star begins as a collapsing cloud of material made mostly of [[hydrogen]], with [[helium]] and tiny amounts of heavier elements. Once the stellar core is dense enough, some of the hydrogen is changed into helium through [[nuclear fusion]].<ref name="sunshine"><span class="citation web"

The star's radiation stops it from collapsing further under its own [[gravity]]. Once the hydrogen fuel at the core has been used up, those stars with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun expand to become a [[red giant]].<ref name="late stages"><span class="citation web"

== Earth and Sun ==
The star nearest to [[Earth]] is the [[Sun]]. It is not accurate to say "most of the [[energy]] on Earth comes from it". It is more accurate to say the [[energy]] of [[sunlight]] supports [[Black smoker#Ecosystems|almost all life]] on Earth by [[photosynthesis]],<ref name=Simon2001>

The Earth has its own source of heat in its interior: see [[Age of the Earth]]. The internal heat comes from the original gravitational formation of the Earth, and from the [[radioactive]] materials inside it.

We can see other stars in the night sky when the Sun goes down. They are made mostly of hydrogen and a little bit of helium plus other elements.  The sun is such a star.

== Planets ==
Most stars look like shiny dots from [[Earth]], because they are far away.  Our [[Sun]] is the closest star to us. The earth moves around (''[[orbit]]s'') the Sun in an oval shape. The Sun and all things that orbit it are called the [[Solar System]]. Many other stars sometimes have [[planet]]s orbiting them too. Scientists have found other planets moving around other stars, but no planets that they have found are similar to Earth.

== Numbers, distances ==
The nearest star to our Solar System, and the second nearest star to Earth after the Sun, is [[Proxima Centauri]]. It is 39.9 [[trillion]] [[kilometre]]s away. This is 4.2 [[light year]]s away, meaning that light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.2 [[year]]s to reach Earth.

[[Astronomer]]s think there are a very large number of stars in the [[Universe]]. They estimate (guess) that there are at least 70 [[sextillion]] stars. That is 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is about 230 billion times the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]] (our [[galaxy]]).

Most stars are very old. They are usually thought to be between 1 and 10 billion years old. The oldest stars are thought to be around 13.7 billion years old. Scientists think that is close to the age of the Universe.

Stars vary greatly in size. The smallest [[neutron star]]s (which are actually dead stars) are no bigger than a city. The neutron star is incredibly dense. If you were to take a layer a [[micrometre]] thick and apply it onto a tank, it would be a very tough armor. The tank would be so heavy, it would sink into the center of the Earth.

[[Supergiant star]]s are the largest objects in the Universe. They have a [[diameter]] about 1,500 times bigger than the Sun.  If you changed the sun into one of these supergiant stars down where the sun is, its outer surface would reach between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and the earth would be inside the star.
The star [[Betelgeuse]], in the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] [[constellation]] is a red supergiant star.

[[Image:Star-sizes.jpg|left|thumb|Stars vary widely in size]]

When seen in the night sky without a telescope, some stars appear brighter than other stars. This difference is measured in terms of [[apparent magnitude]]. There are two reasons for stars to differ in apparent magnitude. If one star is much closer than another otherwise similar star, it will appear much brighter, in just the same way that a [[candle]] that is near looks brighter than a big fire that is far away. If one star is much larger or much hotter than another star at about the same distance, it will appear much brighter, in just the same way that if two fires are the same distance away, the bigger or hotter one will look brighter.

Beside light, stars also give off a [[solar wind]] and [[neutrino]]s. These are very small [[particle]]s.

Stars are a source of a [[gravity]] field. This is what keeps planets close to them. It is also not unusual for two stars to  orbit each other. This happens when they are close together. This is also because of gravity, in the same way as the Earth orbits the Sun.  These [[binary stars]] (binary meaning "two") are thought to be very common. There are even groups of three or more stars orbiting each other. Proxima Centauri is the smallest star in a group of three.

Stars are not spread evenly across all of space. They are grouped into [[galaxy|galaxies]]. A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars.

== History of seeing stars ==
[[Image:Dibuix de Leo.png|thumb|220px|right|People have seen patterns in the stars from long ago.<ref name="forbes" /> This, from 1690, is the [[constellation]] of Leo the lion, as imagined by [[Johannes Hevelius]].<ref><span class="citation book"

Stars have been important to civilizations around the world through [[history]]. They have been part of [[religion|religious]] practices, and long ago, many people believed that stars could never die. Astronomers organized stars into constellations and used them to see the motions of the [[planet]]s and guess the position of the Sun.<ref name="forbes"><span class="citation book"

== Birth and life ==
People think that stars are made in [[nebula]]s. These are big areas of slightly higher [[density]] than normal space.

When very big stars [[death|die]], they explode. This is called a [[supernova]]. When a supernova happens in a nebula, it becomes unstable. This makes parts of the nebula collapse. Stars form in these collapsed areas. The [[Orion Nebula]] is an example of a place where stars form.

Stars spend about 90% of their lives fusing hydrogen to produce [[helium]] in high [[pressure]] reactions near the [[Solar core|core]]. Such stars are said to be on the [[main sequence]].

Small stars (called [[red dwarf]]s) burn their [[fuel]] very slowly and might last tens to hundreds of billions of years. At the end of their lives, they become [[dimness|dimmer]] and dimmer.

Because most stars use up their supply of hydrogen, their outer layers expand and cool to form a [[red giant]]. (Astrophysicists think that in about 5 billion years, the sun will be a red giant.) Eventually the core is [[compression|compressed]] enough to start helium fusion, and the star heats up and contracts. (Larger stars will also fuse heavier elements, all the way to [[iron]].)

An average-size star will then shed its outer layers as a "planetary nebula". The core that remains will be a tiny ball of degenerate matter, not heavy enough for further fusion to take place, supported only by its own pressure, called a [[white dwarf]]. It will fade into a black dwarf over very, very long stretches of time.

In larger stars, fusion continues until collapse ends up causing the star to explode in a [[supernova]]. This is the only cosmic process that happens on human timescales; historically, supernovae have been observed as "new stars" where none existed before. Most of the matter in a star is blown away in the explosion (forming nebulae such as the Crab Nebula) but what remains will collapse into a neutron star (a [[pulsar]] or [[X-ray burster]]) or, in the case of the largest stars, a [[black hole]].

The blown-off outer layers include heavy elements, which are often converted into new stars and/or planets. The flowing out of the gas from supernovae and the [[solar wind|stellar wind]] of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.
